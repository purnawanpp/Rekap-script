NOTE 1 [file nvt.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.


WARNING 1 [file npt.mdp]:
  The Berendsen barostat does not generate any strictly correct ensemble,
  and should not be used for new production simulations (in our opinion).
  For isotropic scaling we would recommend the C-rescale barostat that also
  ensures fast relaxation without oscillations, and for anisotropic scaling
  you likely want to use the Parrinello-Rahman barostat.
